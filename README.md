My final AP Psychology project

HOW TO PLAY
There are 5 units of Psychology in this game: Research Methods/Statistics, Social Psychology, Biological Bases of Behavior, Cognitive Psychology, Psychologist Names

You have 5 hearts, 1 skip, and 1 lifeline when you reach 1 life

Every unit has a total of 8 questions. After completing all 8 questions, your skip resets and you gain 1 heart if you are lower than 5 hearts.

The goal of this game is to quiz your knowledge on Psychology and answer as many questions correctly as possible

Once you complete your quiz, feel free to send your score to be posted onto the leaderboard.

The leaderboard updates every minute.
